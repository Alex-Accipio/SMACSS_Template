# SMACSS_Template
A basic template for SMACSS folder architecture

There are files in the abstract folder showing how to forward abstracts and a file referenced in the styles.scss sheet to show how partials are referenced. 

The abstracts are also referenced in the partial, showing how to pull in abstracts into a partial.
